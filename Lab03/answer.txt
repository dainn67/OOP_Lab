Question: Try to add a method addDigitalVideoDisc which allows to pass an arbitrary number of arguments for dvd. Compare to an array parameter. What do you prefer in this case?

Answer: 
- In the method that receives an array, we have to pass in a fixed array that contain a list of dvds. This requires user to create a list and then pass into the function.
- In the method that receives an arbitrary number of dvds, user can add as much dvds as they want directly to the function. This can benefits in some function to add dvds to the cart without knowing how many dvds.
- Therefore i prefer the second method.

Question: After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two objects still remain? After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) why is the title of the JungleDVD changed

Answer: Because only copies of the objects are passed into the function, so any changes inside the function are meaningless. The title in the second method changed because the funtion now works with the variable directly references to the object in memory, so the title changed
