•	Question: If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?


•	Answer:
-	Yes, it is possible to create a constructor method by “title” and then another constructor method by “category.”
-	This is method overloading, we can create multiple constructors as long as they have different signature, in this case, is the parameters list.
-	Each creating purpose will be corresponding to a constructor method.
